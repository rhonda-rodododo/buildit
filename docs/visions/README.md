# Vision Documents

Visions are multi-epic product direction documents. Each one describes a complete deployment scenario for BuildIt -- a specific movement type, the user needs it serves, and the feature epics required to get there. Visions connect persona research to concrete implementation roadmaps.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [media-collective.md](media-collective.md) | Indymedia-style federated media network -- encrypted collaboration for independent journalists and community media organizations |
| [media-collective-template.md](media-collective-template.md) | Reusable template derived from the media collective vision |

## Planned Visions

- **mutual-aid-network** -- Resource coordination, dispatch, and inventory for mutual aid groups
- **cooperative-governance** -- Decision-making, proposal voting, and transparency tools for co-ops
- **labor-campaign** -- Organizing drives, card signing, and secure worker communication
- **crisis-response** -- High-security rapid coordination for civil defense and emergency contexts
