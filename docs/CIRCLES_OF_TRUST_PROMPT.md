❯ excellent, now lets think about implications - community self reliance means what new features, modules, and templates that we can think of? volunteer coordination, scheduling appointments with care providers, healers, counselors, community care, support and harm reduction groups, organizing day cares and clinics and navigating patients (building off of case management?), providing social support services, eldercare, and care for the disabled in times of crisis (building on mutual aid),  raising large strike funds between unions and federations and making mass payouts for those who apply, organizing beyond the shop floor, mass mobilizations, federations calling for and announcing mass actions, systems for manging community self defense and civil defense to protect communities from rouge state/paramilitary insurgents, intelligence gathering and threat monitoring... what else can you think of? let's brainstorm some real world use cases where communities can mobilize together safely, securely and within circles of trust and affinity, within their local context as well, so communities can protect eachother through unstable and uncertain times                                                                               

● This is the right question. The philosophy is only real if it produces concrete infrastructure. Let me think through this systematically — organized by circles of trust, from the most intimate and local outward to federation-scale coordination.
