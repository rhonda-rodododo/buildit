# DMCA Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## Overview

BuildIt respects intellectual property rights. This policy applies to content
accessible through our Nostr relay infrastructure.

## Technical Limitations

BuildIt uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for private communications. As a
result:

- **Encrypted content**: We cannot access, view, or remove encrypted message
  content (DMs, group messages). We have no technical ability to comply with
  takedown requests for encrypted content.
- **Public relay events**: Non-encrypted public events stored on our relay can
  be subject to DMCA takedown requests.

## Filing a DMCA Notice

For public relay content, send a notice to **dmca@buildit.network** including:

1. Identification of the copyrighted work
2. Identification of the infringing material (event ID, public key)
3. Your contact information
4. A statement of good faith belief
5. A statement of accuracy under penalty of perjury
6. Your physical or electronic signature

## Counter-Notification

If you believe content was wrongly removed, you may file a counter-notification
with the same contact information.
