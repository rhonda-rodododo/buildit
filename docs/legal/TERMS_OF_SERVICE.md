# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## About BuildIt

BuildIt Network ("BuildIt") is a privacy-first, decentralized organizing
platform. By using BuildIt, you agree to these terms.

## Your Account

Your "account" is a cryptographic keypair that you generate locally. BuildIt
does not create accounts, store credentials, or manage identity. You are solely
responsible for safeguarding your private keys.

**If you lose your private keys, we cannot recover them or your data.**

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to use BuildIt to:

- Distribute content that violates applicable law in your jurisdiction
- Harass, threaten, or harm others
- Attempt to compromise the security or privacy of other users
- Interfere with the operation of the relay infrastructure
- Impersonate other users by misusing their public keys

## End-to-End Encryption & Moderation

BuildIt uses end-to-end encryption for private communications. This means:

- We cannot read, moderate, or filter encrypted message content
- Group administrators can moderate content within their groups
- Relay-level moderation is limited to public key blocklists for spam/abuse
- We comply with lawful requests to the extent technically possible, which is
  limited by our inability to access encrypted content

## Service Availability

BuildIt is decentralized software. We provide relay infrastructure on a
best-effort basis. The application continues to function offline and via
BLE mesh without our servers.

## No Warranty

BuildIt is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We are not liable
for any damages arising from your use of the platform. See the AGPL-3.0
license for full terms.

## Intellectual Property

BuildIt is free software licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later. You are free to
use, modify, and distribute it under those terms.

## Changes to These Terms

We will notify users of material changes through the application.
