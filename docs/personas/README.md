# Persona Library

User personas for BuildIt, organized by movement type. Each persona set follows the **Spectrum of Support** methodology, which categorizes stakeholders into five levels:

1. **Active Allies** -- Fully committed, take initiative, recruit others
2. **Passive Allies** -- Supportive but need prompting to act
3. **Neutral/Undecided** -- Uninvolved, could go either way
4. **Passive Opposition** -- Skeptical or disengaged, unlikely to act against
5. **Active Opposition** -- Actively working to undermine efforts

This framework ensures feature design accounts for the full range of users an organizer encounters, not just enthusiastic early adopters.
