# The Innermost Circle: Household and Care Pod (3-12 people)

What the BPP called "survival pending revolution." What disability justice calls interdependence. The smallest unit of mutual care.

## Community Care Coordination

- Care schedules for sick/disabled/elderly members — who's bringing food, who's doing the pharmacy run, who's covering childcare
- Medication tracking and reminders (encrypted, obviously) for members managing chronic conditions
- Appointment scheduling with healers, counselors, bodyworkers, traditional medicine practitioners — a community health directory maintained by the community itself
- Harm reduction support: Narcan distribution tracking, safe use check-ins, peer support scheduling. No judgment in the architecture.
- Crisis companion matching — when someone is in mental health crisis, who in their trust circle is available right now?
- Grief and trauma circles — structured support groups with rotating facilitation

## Cooperative Childcare and Eldercare

- Shared childcare scheduling (the Mujeres Libres model — they built this during a civil war)
- Eldercare coordination — medication, meals, companionship, transportation
- Disability support coordination — attendant care scheduling, accessible transportation, equipment sharing
- Respite care matching — caregivers need rest too

## Household Economics

- Shared expense tracking for co-ops and intentional communities
- Solidarity lending circles (tandas, susus, ROSCAs — these exist in every culture)
- Shared pantry / meal planning
- Tool and equipment libraries — who has the drill, who has the truck


# The Neighborhood Circle: Block and Building (12-150 people)

The scale of Sankara's CDRs, the Panther chapters, the Zapatista community assembly.

## Tenant Organizing

- Building-wide condition documentation (mold, heat failures, code violations) — encrypted, timestamped, photographic evidence that belongs to the tenants
- Rent strike coordination — who's in, who's holding, collective fund management
- Repair request tracking and landlord accountability documentation
- Emergency housing placement when someone gets evicted
- Know Your Rights distribution specific to local tenant law

## Community Health Infrastructure

- Free clinic coordination — volunteer scheduling, supply inventory, patient navigation
- Community health worker routing — who needs a wellness check, who needs a referral
- Case management for people navigating social services — the bureaucracy is the enemy, the navigator is the ally
- Reproductive health access networks — especially critical post-Dobbs, this needs the highest security tier
- First aid / street medic coordination for actions and for daily life

## Food Sovereignty

- Community kitchen scheduling and volunteer coordination
- Community garden plot management, seed libraries, harvest sharing
- Food rescue coordination — restaurant/grocery surplus routed to community fridges
- Collective meal planning and cooking circles
- Emergency food distribution during crisis (the Panther Free Breakfast model, digitized)

## Community Safety Without Police

- De-escalation team dispatch — community members trained in crisis intervention, dispatchable like a non-police 911
- Neighborhood watch reimagined — not surveillance, but mutual awareness and rapid response to fires, medical emergencies, domestic violence
- Walking escorts for vulnerable community members
- Environmental hazard monitoring — air quality, water quality, industrial accidents
- Missing persons coordination within community networks before (or instead of) involving police

# The Organizational Circle: Union, Co-op, Collective (50-500 people)

The LRBW three-level model. The Mondragon governance structure. The Mujeres Libres federation.

Workplace Organizing (Beyond the Shop Floor)

- Grievance documentation system — encrypted, timestamped, categorized (safety, discrimination, wage theft, retaliation)
- Structure tests digitized — tracking where every worker stands on the spectrum, who's ready for what level of public action
- One-on-one meeting logging — the backbone of labor organizing, with relationship depth tracking over time
- Multi-site coordination — DRUM had a different RUM for every plant. A union campaign across 20 warehouses or 50 restaurants needs cross-site coordination with per-site autonomy
- Unfair labor practice documentation for NLRB filings
- Contract campaign tracking — demands, bargaining sessions, tentative agreements, ratification votes

## Strike Infrastructure

- Strike fund management — contributions in, hardship disbursements out, transparent accounting
- Picket line scheduling and coordination
- Strike kitchen logistics — food, water, supplies for the line
- Scab documentation (legally and carefully)
- Solidarity actions coordination with other unions and community groups
- Hardship fund applications — workers apply, committee reviews, funds disbursed. All encrypted, all auditable by the membership.
- Inter-union federation strike funds — when multiple unions pool resources for a major action, the accounting must be transparent to all member unions while protecting individual worker privacy

## Cooperative Governance

- Worker-owner assembly facilitation — agenda, stack, proposals, votes, minutes
- Role rotation scheduling with knowledge transfer workflows
- Open books — financial transparency to all members
- Balanced job complex tracking — is the empowering work distributed equitably, or are some people always doing the dishes while others always do the strategizing?
- Conflict resolution / restorative justice processes
- New member onboarding and mentorship matching

# The Movement Circle: Coalition, Federation, Front (500-50,000 people)

Hampton's Rainbow Coalition. Ho Chi Minh's united front. The Zapatista caracoles.

## Mass Mobilization

- General strike coordination — citywide, cross-union, cross-sector. This is Luxemburg's mass strike: you don't call it from above, you provide infrastructure so that when organic conditions produce it, the networks are ready
- Mass action logistics — rally points, march routes, contingency plans, medical stations, legal observer positions, jail support coordination. All in encrypted channels that self-destruct if needed.
- Federation-level action calls — a regional federation of unions or community organizations announces a day of action, and the call propagates through the network to every affiliated local
- Transportation coordination for mobilizations — buses, carpools, accessible transit
- Childcare for mobilizations — you can't expect single parents to show up at the march if there's no childcare at the church down the block
- Accessibility coordination — ASL interpreters, wheelchair-accessible routes, sensory-reduced spaces, real-time captioning

## Coalition Infrastructure

- Spokescouncil facilitation — each organization sends a mandated delegate, decisions are tracked, report-backs to home organizations
- Shared campaign platforms — joint demands, joint messaging, coordinated action calendars
- Resource sharing across organizations — one org has a sound system, another has a legal team, another has a fleet of vans
- Power mapping across the coalition — which elected officials do we collectively have leverage over? What's our combined density in each precinct/ward/district?
- Joint political education — study groups that cross organizational lines, building shared analysis

## Strike Fund Federations

- Multi-union solidarity funds with democratic governance
- Automatic hardship assessment workflows — worker applies, local reviews, federation funds disburse
- Transparent accounting visible to all member unions
- Emergency strike authorization votes across a federation
- International strike solidarity — funds flowing across borders to support allied workers' actions

# The Community Defense Circle: Civil Defense, Protection, Resilience

This is the highest-security tier. RAM's clandestine methodology. The Deacons for Defense. The Zapatista autonomous security.

## Civil Defense and Community Protection

- Emergency communication trees — cascading alerts via BLE mesh when internet is down
- Rapid response networks — "ICE at Broadway and 5th" propagates instantly through community, everyone knows within minutes
- Safe house network coordination — encrypted, access-controlled, need-to-know. Who has space, who needs shelter, right now.
- Legal observer networks — check-in/check-out, real-time incident documentation, post-action report compilation
- Buddy systems with automated welfare checks — if you don't check in by the designated time, your buddy gets an alert, then your secondary contact, then the network
- Community patrol coordination — routes, check-ins, incident reporting
- Threat monitoring and intelligence — documenting patterns of state/paramilitary activity, mapping known surveillance infrastructure, tracking patterns of harassment and intimidation. All compartmentalized, all encrypted, all deniable.
- Evacuation planning — pre-planned routes, rally points, supply caches, vulnerable member priority lists
- Supply chain management for crisis — water, food, medical supplies, fuel. Who has what, where is it, how do we distribute it when the infrastructure fails?

## Crisis Communication

- Offline-first mesh broadcasting — when cell towers go down, BLE mesh keeps the neighborhood connected
- Community radio integration — digital coordination for analog broadcast
- Multi-language emergency alerts
- Accessibility-first emergency communication — not everyone can read a text message in a crisis. Audio alerts. Visual alerts. Haptic alerts.
- Dead drop coordination — physical message relay points for when even BLE is compromised

## Documentation and Accountability

- Human rights violation documentation — structured, timestamped, geolocated (optionally), encrypted, with chain-of-custody for potential legal or international use
- Witness coordination — multiple independent accounts of the same incident, cross-referenced
- Evidence preservation — encrypted, distributed storage so that device seizure doesn't destroy the record
- Pattern analysis — when individual incidents connect into a pattern of coordinated repression

# The Solidarity Circle: International, Cross-Border

Newton's intercommunalism. RAM's global vision. The Zapatista international encounters.

## International Solidarity

- Cross-border communication with nation-state-level encryption
- Political prisoner support — letter-writing campaigns, commissary funds, court date tracking, solidarity actions
- International days of action coordination
- Supply chain solidarity — workers at a factory in one country coordinating with consumers/workers in another
- Secure translation workflows — documents translated without exposing content to third-party services
- Sister community / sister organization relationships
- Refugee support networks — from country of origin through transit to resettlement, continuous encrypted communication

# Cross-Cutting Capabilities

Things that need to exist at every level:

## Community Knowledge Infrastructure

- Study circles with structured curricula (RAM's model)
- Oral history archives — voice recordings, encrypted, community-owned
- Know Your Rights libraries — localized, multilingual, downloadable for offline
- Skill-share directories — who knows what, who can teach what
- Community journalism — collaborative investigation, source protection, secure publishing
- Language preservation — for indigenous and diaspora communities maintaining their languages

## Community Economics

- Participatory budgeting — community members decide how shared funds are spent
- Time banks — exchange labor without money
- Community investment funds — collectively investing in community-owned enterprises
- Solidarity economy directories — cooperative businesses, worker-owned enterprises, community land trusts
- Reparative/redistributive funds — communities choosing to redistribute resources toward those most impacted

## Restorative and Transformative Justice

- Community accountability processes — structured, facilitated, documented (with consent), with clear milestones
- Conflict resolution facilitation — when two members or two organizations have a conflict, the platform supports structured dialogue
- Harm circles — restorative justice processes for when harm occurs within the community
- Reentry support — coordinating housing, employment, and community reintegration for people coming home from incarceration
