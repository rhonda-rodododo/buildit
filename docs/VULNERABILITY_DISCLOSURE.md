**Response Time**:
- Initial acknowledgment: Within 72 hours
- Status update: Within 7 days
- Resolution timeline: Varies by severity (see below)

### What to Include

Please provide:
1. **Vulnerability Description**: Clear explanation of the issue
2. **Impact Assessment**: What could an attacker accomplish?
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code/screenshots demonstrating the issue
5. **Affected Versions**: Which versions are vulnerable?
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas (optional)
7. **Your Contact Info**: For follow-up questions

### Encryption

For sensitive reports, please use our PGP key:
- [PGP Key URL to be added]
- Fingerprint: [To be added]

## Scope

### In Scope

We are interested in vulnerabilities affecting:

**Critical Severity**:
- Private key exposure or leakage
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Encryption weaknesses (NIP-44, NIP-17, AES-GCM)
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection or NoSQL injection (if applicable)

**High Severity**:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) - reflected or stored
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Session hijacking or fixation
- Insecure key generation or storage
- Rate limiting bypass

**Medium Severity**:
- Information disclosure (beyond intended)
- Weak cryptographic practices
- Missing security headers
- Open redirects
- Clickjacking

**Low Severity**:
- Best practice violations
- Low-impact information disclosure
- UI/UX security issues

### Out of Scope

The following are generally out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks on users
- Physical security of devices
- Denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks
- Issues in third-party Nostr relays or services
- Self-XSS requiring user action
- Vulnerabilities in outdated browsers
- Reports from automated scanners without validation
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept

**Note**: If you're unsure whether something is in scope, please ask!

## Guidelines

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

1. **Give us time**: Allow us to fix the issue before public disclosure
2. **Act in good faith**: Don't exploit vulnerabilities or access user data
3. **Be respectful**: Follow our policies and respect user privacy
4. **Limit impact**: Use test accounts only, don't disrupt service
5. **Be clear**: Provide detailed reports to help us understand the issue

### What We Promise

In return, we will:

1. **Respond promptly**: Acknowledge reports within 72 hours
2. **Keep you informed**: Regular updates on fix status
3. **Give credit**: Acknowledge you in release notes (if desired)
4. **Act fairly**: No legal action for good-faith security research
5. **Be transparent**: Public disclosure coordinated with you

## Response Timeline

### Severity Definitions

**Critical** (CVSS 9.0-10.0):
- Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- Resolution target: 7 days
- Public disclosure: After fix deployed + 7 days

**High** (CVSS 7.0-8.9):
- Significant security impact
- Resolution target: 30 days
- Public disclosure: After fix deployed + 14 days

**Medium** (CVSS 4.0-6.9):
- Moderate security impact
- Resolution target: 90 days
- Public disclosure: After fix deployed + 30 days

**Low** (CVSS 0.1-3.9):
- Limited security impact
- Resolution target: 180 days
- Public disclosure: After fix deployed + 60 days

## Recognition

### Hall of Fame

We maintain a security researcher hall of fame:
- [https://builditnetwork.org/security-acknowledgments]

Researchers credited (with permission):
- Name/Handle
- Organization (optional)
- Vulnerability type
- Date reported

### Potential Rewards

While we do not currently offer bug bounties, we may provide:
- Public acknowledgment
- Swag/merchandise
- Letter of recommendation (for career development)
- Future consideration for bounty program

## Legal

### Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Follow this disclosure policy
- Act in good faith
- Do not violate laws beyond what is necessary for security research
- Do not access or exfiltrate user data
- Do not disrupt service availability

### Restrictions

Please do not:
- Access or modify user data without explicit permission
- Perform attacks that degrade service (DoS/DDoS)
- Use social engineering against employees/users
- Demand payment or ransom
- Violate privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## Examples

### Good Report Example

```
Title: Stored XSS in Group Description Field

Severity: High

Description:
The group description field does not properly sanitize HTML input,
allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that executes
when other users view the group page.

Impact:
An attacker could steal session tokens, perform actions as other users,
or redirect users to phishing sites.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Create a new group
2. Set description to: <img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">
3. View the group page as another user
4. JavaScript executes in victim's browser

Affected Versions: v0.30.0 and earlier

Suggested Fix:
Sanitize HTML input using DOMPurify before rendering.
Implement Content Security Policy to block inline scripts.

POC: [screenshot attached]
```

### Bad Report Example

```
Title: Security Issue

Description: I found a vulnerability

(Lacks details, reproduction steps, impact assessment)
```
