Think of it like a digital passport that only you control.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Public Key (npub)\n- This is like your username\n- You can share it with others\n- Used to receive encrypted messages\n\n### Private Key (nsec)\n- This is like your password\n- **NEVER share this with anyone**\n- Used to decrypt messages and sign actions\n\n## Creating Your Identity\n\n1. Open BuildIt and tap \"Create New Identity\"\n2. Choose a display name (can be a pseudonym)\n3. Optionally add a profile picture\n4. Your keys are automatically generated\n\n## Backing Up Your Keys\n\n**CRITICAL**: If you lose your private key, you lose access to all your messages and groups forever. There is no \"forgot password\" option.\n\n### Backup Options\n\n1. **Write it down** - Store on paper in a secure location\n2. **Password manager** - Use a reputable password manager\n3. **Hardware wallet** - For advanced security\n\n## Security Tips\n\n- Use a unique identity for sensitive organizing\n- Don't link your real identity unless necessary\n- Consider using Tor for additional privacy"

Receive an invite link from a group member\n2. Open the link in BuildIt\n3. Review the group information\n4. Click \"Join\" (or \"Request to Join\" for closed groups)\n\n## Creating a Group\n\n1.

Let's understand how it works.\n\n## What is Encryption?\n\nEncryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using a key. Only those with the correct key can decrypt it.\n\n## Types of Encryption\n\n### Symmetric Encryption\n- Same key encrypts and decrypts\n- Fast and efficient\n- Challenge: How to share the key securely?\n- Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)\n\n### Asymmetric (Public Key) Encryption\n- Two keys: public and private\n- Public key encrypts, private key decrypts\n- No need to share secret keys\n- Example: RSA, Elliptic Curve (secp256k1)\n\n### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)\n- Messages encrypted on your device\n- Decrypted only on recipient's device\n- Service provider cannot read content\n- BuildIt uses E2EE for all messages\n\n## Encryption in BuildIt\n\n### NIP-44 (Content Encryption)\n- ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm\n- Encrypts message content\n- Shared secret derived from keys\n\n### NIP-17 (Gift Wrapping)\n- Wraps encrypted message in another layer\n- Hides metadata (who's talking to whom)\n- Additional privacy protection\n\n## Encryption Limitations\n\n- Encryption protects content, not always metadata\n- Doesn't protect if device is compromised\n- Doesn't prevent recipient from sharing\n- Key management is critical\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Perfect Forward Secrecy\n- Even if keys are compromised later, past messages remain secure\n- Achieved through ephemeral key exchange\n\n### Deniability\n- Cannot prove a specific person sent a message\n- Important for plausible deniability\n\n### Key Verification\n- How do you know a public key belongs to who you think?\n- Out-of-band verification is important" } },
