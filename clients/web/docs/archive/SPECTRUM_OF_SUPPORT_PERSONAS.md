# BuildIt Network - Spectrum of Support User Personas

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Framework**: Based on Training for Change's Spectrum of Support methodology
**Purpose**: Design features for the full spectrum of organizing engagement, from core organizers to casual supporters

---

## Understanding the Spectrum of Support

The Spectrum of Support maps people across **5 levels of engagement**:

1. **Active Support** - Agree with us AND taking action alongside us
2. **Passive Support** - Agree with us, but aren't doing anything (yet!)
3. **Neutral** - Aren't sure, don't care, and/or are uninformed
4. **Passive Opposition** - Disagree with us, but aren't doing anything to stop us
5. **Active Opposition** - Disagree with us AND taking action against us

**Organizing Principle**: We build power by **shifting groups toward us**, one step at a time. We don't need to convert active opposition to active support - we win by moving neutrals to passive support, passive opposition to neutral, etc.

**For BuildIt Network**: We need features for **all 5 levels**, recognizing that:
- **Active supporters** need powerful organizing tools
- **Passive supporters** need low-friction ways to engage
- **Neutrals** need information and storytelling
- **Passive/Active opposition** need exposure of their interests (research tools, narrative strategy)

## Cross-Cutting Themes: Feature Needs Across the Spectrum

### 1. Engagement Ladder (Moving People Up the Spectrum)

**Problem**: How do we move people from Neutral → Passive Support → Active Support?

**Solution: Progressive Engagement Features**

| Level | Entry Point | First Action | Deepening Engagement | Leadership |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Neutral** | Visit public page | Watch 2-min video | Attend public event | - |
| **Passive Support** | Join group (read-only) | React to post | Vote in poll | - |
| **Active Support** | Post in group chat | RSVP to meeting | 1-on-1 organizing | - |
| **Core Organizer** | Lead organizing meeting | Recruit 5 people | Run subcommittee | Campaign director |

**Features to Build:**

1. **Engagement Pathways**
   - Automated suggestions: "You joined 2 weeks ago. Ready to take action? Here's how →"
   - Milestone celebrations: "You just attended your first event! 🎉"
   - Personalized next steps: "People like you often enjoy [action type]"

2. **Low-Barrier Entry Points**
   - Anonymous polls (no login required)
   - Public events (no RSVP required, just show up)
   - Read-only mode (join without committing)
   - "Invite a friend" (safety in numbers)

3. **Escalation Mechanics**
   - "Ladder of engagement" visualization (show your journey)
   - Unlock features as you engage (gamification lite)
   - Peer invitations ("Marcus invited you to join the organizing committee")

### 2. Information vs. Action (Different Needs by Spectrum Level)

**Active Support** needs ACTION tools:
- ✅ CRM for tracking conversations
- ✅ Event creation and management
- ✅ Task assignment and tracking
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Bulk operations (text 50 people)
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Campaign analytics

**Passive Support** needs ACTIVATION tools:
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Activity feed (see what's happening)
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Lightweight tasks ("Share this post")
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Celebration posts (build morale)
- ✅ Reactions and comments

**Neutral** needs INFORMATION tools:
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Public pages (explain the campaign)
- ⚠️ **NEED**: FAQ/explainer content
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Storytelling (testimonials, wins)

**Opposition** needs EXPOSURE tools (for organizers):
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Opposition research (track anti-union consultants)
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Narrative tracking (what are they saying?)
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Power mapping (who influences our target?)
- ⚠️ **NEED**: Contrast messaging (our values vs. theirs)

### 3. Privacy vs. Visibility (Tension Across the Spectrum)

**The Dilemma:**
- **Active Support**: Needs maximum privacy (OPSEC, protect organizers)
- **Passive Support**: Needs some visibility (see the movement is real)
- **Neutral**: Needs public content (learn about the campaign)

**Solution: Granular Privacy Controls**

| Content Type | Privacy Options | Who Can See |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Campaign landing page** | Public | Anyone (including opposition) |
| **Rally photos/wins** | Public or Followers | Build momentum, show strength |
| **Organizing conversations** | Group or Private | Only trusted members |
| **Direct action plans** | Direct-Action (encrypted) | Core organizers only |
| **1-on-1 outreach notes** | Private | Individual organizer only |

**Features to Build:**

1. **Smart Defaults by Content Type**
   - Rally announcement: Default to Public
   - House meeting: Default to Group
   - Escalation tactics: Default to Direct-Action
   - Organizing notes: Default to Private

2. **Privacy Wizards**
   - "Who should see this post?" (with recommendations)
   - "Warning: This will be public. Continue?" (for sensitive identities)

3. **Visibility Analytics**
   - "Your public posts have reached 500 people"
   - "Your group has 50 active members and 30 observers"

### 4. Storytelling & Narrative Strategy

**Why It Matters**: We move people up the spectrum through **storytelling**, not just facts.

**Spectrum-Specific Narratives:**

| Audience | Their Question | Narrative Approach | Content Type |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Neutral** | "Why should I care?" | Personal stories, concrete benefits | Testimonial video, wage calculator |
| **Passive Support** | "Can we really win?" | Show wins, momentum, power analysis | Victory posts, membership growth |
| **Active Support** | "What do I do next?" | Strategic clarity, role definition | Campaign plan, task assignments |
| **Passive Opposition** | "What are they hiding?" | Transparency, values contrast | Public metrics, open meetings |
| **Active Opposition** | - | Expose their interests, isolate | Research database, contrast messaging |

**Features to Build:**

1. **Storytelling Tools**
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Testimonial templates (record short video, post with privacy controls)
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Win celebration posts (share victories to build momentum)
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Timeline/narrative view (show campaign arc: "We started here, now we're here")

2. **Narrative Library**
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Talking points database (messages for different audiences)
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Counter-narrative tracking (what is opposition saying? How do we respond?)
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Values framing (our values vs. their interests)

3. **Multi-Platform Storytelling**
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Share to external platforms (post win to Instagram/Twitter)
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Embeddable content (put victory post on external website)
   - ⚠️ **NEED**: Press release generator (auto-generate media statements)

2. **Movement is the Goal**
   - Success = moving people one step toward us
   - Build "engagement ladders" with clear next steps
   - Celebrate milestones to show progress

3. **Privacy is Contextual**
   - Public content builds momentum (wins, rally photos)
   - Encrypted content protects organizers (tactics, lists)
   - Give users granular control + smart defaults

4. **Storytelling Moves People**
   - Neutral → Passive: "Here's what we're fighting for"
   - Passive → Active: "Here's your role in winning"
   - Active → Core: "Here's how we analyze power and build strategy"

### Design Principle for BuildIt Network

**"Meet people where they are on the spectrum, and give them a path to the next level."**

This means:
- Public landing pages for neutrals
- Low-barrier entry points for passive supporters
- Powerful organizing tools for active supporters
- OpSec and privacy for high-risk campaigns
- Transparency and accountability to neutralize opposition

BuildIt Network should be the **only tool that serves the full spectrum** - from casual observer to lead organizer.
